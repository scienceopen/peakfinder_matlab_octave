`A peak-finding suite for MATLAB and GNU Octave by `Thomas C. O'Haver <http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~toh/spectrum/PeakFindingandMeasurement.htm>`_

In case the author's website disappears someday, and to provide increased visibility for those who don't or won't use Matlab File Exchange.
Also to promote collaboration in development, especially for Octave users.
